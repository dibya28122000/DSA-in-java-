# 🚀 Java DSA – Daily LeetCode Practice

This repository is a collection of my **daily DSA practice in Java**, where I solve LeetCode problems to strengthen my fundamentals and improve problem-solving skills. As a beginner, my main focus is on understanding concepts clearly, breaking problems into smaller steps, and writing code that is simple, readable, and gradually more optimized. This repo also helps me stay consistent and track how much I grow over time.

### 📌 What You'll Find Here

* Daily Java solutions with clear naming
* Beginner-friendly approaches
* Notes explaining logic and tricky concepts
* Improvements or optimized versions of earlier solutions

### 🎯 My Learning Goals

* Build strong core DSA knowledge
* Develop confidence in solving coding problems
* Learn patterns like two pointers, sliding window, recursion, etc.
* Keep practicing every single day to form a habit
