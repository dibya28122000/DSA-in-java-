🌱 My Daily DSA Learning Journey

Hey! Welcome to my little space where I upload the DSA problems I solve every day on LeetCode.
I’m still in the early stages of learning, picking things up slowly, and this repo keeps me motivated and on track.

I’m not a DSA expert yet — just someone trying to improve one problem at a time. 🙂

✨ Why I Started This

I began this journey because:

I want to build a strong DSA base

I want to think more logically and clearly

I want to feel confident in coding interviews

And most importantly… I want to stay consistent every single day

Even if I solve just one problem, it still moves me forward. 💪

📂 What You’ll Find Here

This repo includes:

My daily LeetCode solutions

Simple, beginner-friendly code

Easy-to-understand approaches

Problems organized by topics

📁 Current Folders

Arrays, Strings, HashMap, TwoPointers, LinkedList, Stack, Recursion, Others
(I’ll keep adding new topics as I grow.)

🛠 Tools / Languages

Right now, I mainly use Java.
I’ll start exploring other languages once I get more comfortable.

🎯 What I’m Aiming For

Being consistent with practice

Gradually moving from Easy → Medium → Hard

Truly understanding concepts

Building interview confidence

No rush — just slow, steady improvement.

💬 A Small Message

I’m still learning, so some solutions may be basic or not the most optimized.
But that’s perfectly fine. This repo is all about learning and growing over time.
